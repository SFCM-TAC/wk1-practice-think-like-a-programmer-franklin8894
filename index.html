    <h1>Think Like a Programmer</h1>
    <div class="question">
      Pretend you are writing a plugin that automatically harmonizes with MIDI input.
      What instructions would you give a computer to do this programmatically?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      Assign notes (frequencies) to be played simultaneously with the note that is triggered in MIDI. For example, assign an E to a C, so that a major 3rd harmony would sound if the C is triggered.

    </div>
    <div class="question">
      Pick an instrument and pretend you are writing an app that mimics that instrument.
      How would you model the istrument in a way the computer would understand?
      Think about what different objects (e.g. "string" for a guitar) it might
      need and what properties (e.g. "pitch"), events (e.g. "pluck"),
      and methods (e.g. "playPitch()") would be useful.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">

      Piano. Would require pitches, velocity (volume), tone, and duration (sustain pedal).
